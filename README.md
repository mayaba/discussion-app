A fun discussion application, built using Meteor and React frameworks, that allow users to add new discussions or comment on existing ones.
In this application, I took advantges of some of the Meteor supported features, such as Methods and built-in account management. I removed the "insecure" package to restrict the connection between the front-end and back-end to be only by Meteor methods. Alongside the packages that are provided by Meteor, I used Robohash API, which provides a unique profile photo for any queried text [https://robohash.org/]. I, also, used Bootstrap and ReactStrap for styling.
